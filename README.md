[AgentCraft Hackathon](https://www.tensorops.ai/aiagentsonlinehackathon) organized by **Diamant AI** in collaboration with **LangChain**. 

[Preparation Event for Participants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuH4hwG73wM&t=195s)

**Challenge:** Build a tutorial for an Agent 
- **Innovation & Creativity:** Suprise with your agent idea, create agents that capture tasks in which there are few examples for implementation.
- **Educational:** Create a tutorial that people can learn from, reproduce for their purposes.
- **Elegance:** Clean code, clear instructions, well documented and elegant presentation.
- **Usefulness:** The tutorial solves a real problem.

**Timeline:**
  - **Competition Begins:** 18:00 CET Nov 14th 2024
  - **Submission Deadline:** 23:59 EST Nov 17th 2024

**Guidelines:**
  - **Agent Development:** Build agents using any platform or framework. Tutorials must be in Python, contained in a Jupyter notebook, with no external runtime and demonstrate both creation and usage.
  - **Open Source Access:** The repo is open-source and acessible without extra costs or credit card requirements.
  - **Service Integration:** Integration with paid services like LLMs and Weather API's but ensure the core agent workflow can also operate with open-source alternatives.
  - **Demo Data:** Operate the agent with demo data (if needed) in a `/data` directory capped at 10MB. 
  - **Language:** The tutorial must be in English.
  - **Tutorial Inclusion:** Accepted tutorials will be added to the repository.
  - **Submission Method:** Submit via a GitHub pull request + a form with your files and a 3-minute Youtube pitch video.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Data Analysis Report Generation Agent | Transforming Data into Insightful Reports

The `aim` is to create an `intelligent multi-agent system` that simplifies the process of generating comprehensive `data analysis reports` using **LLM Agents**.

#### Project Goals:

- **Automated Report Generation:** Streamline the creation of detailed `data analysis reports`.

- **Easy Data Interpretation:** Provide clear and actionable insights from complex datasets for `non-technical stakeholders`.

#### Tech Stack:

**`TBD`**
